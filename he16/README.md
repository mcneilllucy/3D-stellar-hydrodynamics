# Movies for rapidly rotating he16 model

Here we show .gifs of 2D slices (i.e. azimuthally averaged) of quantities related to differential rotation, in the inner most convective oxygen burning region.

## Angular velocity

(rotation rate)

## Radial velocity

(convective updrafts and downdrafts)

![vr](movies/2D_v_r_movie.gif)

## Latitudinal velocity

(meridional circulation)

![vtheta](movies/2D_v_theta_movie.gif)

Next we show .gifs of the (spherically averaged) radial entropy profiles (black) over the course of the simulation, along with the corresponding oxygen shell definition (cyan) at that time.

## Entropy vs radius

## Entropy vs mass
